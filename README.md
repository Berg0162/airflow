# PWM <br>

The AC Dimmer Module by Robotdyn is designed to control the alternating current voltage (110/220), which can transfer current up to 400V/8–ê. In most cases, the AC Dimmer Module is used to turning the power ON/OFF for lamps or heating elements, it can also be used in fans, pumps, air cleaners, e.t.c. A major benefit of the Robotdyn board is that the 110/220V part is (optically) isolated from the 5V logical control part, to exclude the possibility of high voltage damage of the microcontroller. The logical level of the Dimmer Module is tolerant to 5V and 3.3V, therefore it can be connected to a microcontroller with 5V and 3.3V level logic. <br>

For our Arduino Feather nRF52 a dedicated Timer/Interrupt handling library has been applied, which uses external interrupts and process time interrupts to switch AC power ON/OFF to allow PWM on the fans. The AC Dimmer is connected to the Arduino Feather nRF52 board via two digital pins. A first (interrupt) pin to detect the Zero Crossing of the 50 Hz AC Phase, which is used to initiate an interrupt signal to start the cut-off of the cycle. A second pin (PWM) to control the width (or time) of the cut-off duration of the cycle, which determines how long the current is ON/OFF.<br clear="left">
